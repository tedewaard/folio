      <p>Most of my career has been spent at a company that hosts their infrastructure on prem. Like most
        companies, that means VMware ESXi for our hypervisor. I've always been interested in automation and really
        wanted a reason to use Terraform, despite not being a cloud shop. So, I set out to automate our VM provisioning
        in order to save time, make the process consistent and reliable, and add the benefits of version control.</p>

      <h2>The Old Process</h2>

      <Callout type="info" title="Linux VMs">This article will focus on our linux VMs, which happen
        to be Ubuntu server. But I also got it working for Windows Server as well.</Callout>

      <p>The old process consisted of creating a new base VM from an ISO. Then, installing any
        base applications and configurations that can live in the template image. These would be apps
        that don't care about or bind themselves to any unique identifiers.</p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crowdstrike EDR</li>
        <li>DUO for MFA during server authentication</li>
        <li>Configs - Firewall, SNMP, Users, SSH keys</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, we would add a bash script that does additional configuration after cloning the template
        and logging into the server. This script involved user interaction like specifying the hostname, 
        network config, joining the domain, and installing software that does need to attach to unique identifiers (like 
        enrolling the VM in our RMM).</p>

      <h3>Concerns with this setup</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few key issues with how we were doing things. First, too much configuration in the 
        template itself. I mean, not the biggest deal and I could probably take a look at using packer 
        to build our templates. But I'd rather keep the template as lean as possible and handle the customization 
        with cloud-init and ansible. Second, the bash script used for additional configuration is just not it. 
        Any changes to the script would need to be updated in the template, but more importantly, the script requires
        user interaction and manually entering information, which was just begging for fat finger errors.
        Additionally, it meant I couldn't spin up multiple VMs and configure them at the same time. I'd have to
        go one by one, which takes time when you're trying to spin up a 10 node Kubernetes cluster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is a combination of 3 tools - terraform, cloud-init and ansible. Configurations for all
        three can live in version control, giving us the ability to iterate and rollback if needed. It also makes
        everything repeatable, consistent and clearly documents what's happening (this has been handy for compliance).
        Finally, it's so much faster. 
      </p>

      <h2>The Implementation</h2>

      <h3>Cloud-Init</h3>

      <p>
        We still need the VM template to clone our new VMs from, but we will only configure cloud-init.
        Which, looks like the following:
      </p>

      <p>First, we need to tell cloud-init that our <a href="https://docs.cloud-init.io/en/latest/reference/datasources/vmware.html">datasource</a> is VMware and we are using Guest OS 
        Customization by adding the following file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d:
      </p>

      <CodeBlock language="yaml" title="99-vmware-guest-customization.cfg">
        {`datasource:
  VMware:
    vmware_cust_file_max_wait: 10
        `}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Then, in the cloud.cfg file that already exists we want to comment out the default
        user lines. We will be injecting our own base user in our cloud-init userdata via Terraform.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock language="yaml" title="cloud.cfg">
      {`#Add the following line:
disable_vmware_customization: false
#Comment out the following lines using a # like below:
#Users:
#  - default
  # Default user name + that default users groups (if added/used)
  #default_user:
  #  name: ubuntu
  #  lock_passwd: True
  #  gecos: Ubuntu
  #  groups: [adm, audio, cdrom, dialout, dip, floppy, lxd, netdev, plugdev, sudo, video]
  #  sudo: ["ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"]
  #  shell: /bin/bash
        `}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Now, we run the following commands to make sure the VM is ready for Cloud-Init 
        and we have a clean run on next boot:
      </p>
      
      <CodeBlock language="bash" title="cloud.cfg">
{`sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/*
sudo rm /var/lib/cloud-init/*
sudo cloud-init clean --machine-id

`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Once we've made a template from our VM we are ready to move on to Terraform,
        which will be the tool used to define our VMs and trigger their provisioning in 
        VMware. 
      </p>

      <h3>Terraform</h3>
      
      <p>The VMware provider for Terraform is pretty straight forward -
         <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vmware/vsphere/latest/docs"> vSphere Provider</a>.
      But what I want to touch on is how to go about injecting your cloud-init metadata
        so that you can set the network config via cloud-init and any other configurations
        you want to add like users and groups. Below is a vsphere_virtual_machine resource
        with most arguments removed since I just want to highlight the 'extra_config'
        argument. I can pass extra guestinfo properties like metadata, and userdata. 
        I supply the yaml, which is jsonencoded and then base64encoded. The metadata and
        user data allow me to set the IP configuration, some base packages to be installed 
        and users/groups that I want. 
      </p>

      <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="main.tf">
{`
resource "vsphere_virtual_machine" "vm" {

  extra_config = {
    "guestinfo.metadata" = base64encode(jsonencode({
      instance-id    = each.key
      local-hostname = each.value.hostname
      network = {
        version = 2
        ethernets = {
          any_ens = {
            match = {
              name = "ens*"
            }
            addresses = ["\${each.value.ip_address}/\${var.subnet}"]
            gateway4  = var.gateway
            nameservers = {
              addresses = ["10.1.22.20", "10.1.22.21"]
              search    = ["domain.com"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
      }
    ))
    "guestinfo.metadata.encoding" = "base64"
    "guestinfo.userdata" = base64encode(<<EOF
        #cloud-config
        package_update: true
        package_upgrade: true
        packages:
        - firewalld
        - snmpd
        groups:
          - testgroup: [test]
        users:
          - name: test
            gecos: test
            primary_group: test
            groups: [sudo, testgroup]
            lock_passwd: false
            hashed_passwd: >-
              <hashed password here>
            shell: /bin/bash
        EOF
    )
    "guestinfo.userdata.encoding" = "base64"
  }
}
`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>You'll also notice that within my guestinfo.metadata I'm passing in variables. 
        These variables are coming from a map of objects, where each object represents 
        a VM configuration:
      </p>

      <CodeBlock language='javascript' title='variables.tf'>
{`variable "vm_configs" {
    type = map(object({
        hostname =  string
        ip_address = string
        datastore = string
        disks = list(object({
            label = string
            size = number
        }))
        mem = number
        cpu = number
    }))
}`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>If I want to spin up 3 VMs I simply pass a vm_configs map of my VM attributes like the following:</p>

      <CodeBlock language='javascript' title='main.tf'>
 {`         
vm_configs = {
    "VM1" = {
      hostname   = "VM1"
      ip_address = "10.1.122.100"
      datastore = "dstore-1"
      disks      = [
        {
            label = "disk0"
            size = 60
        },
        {
            label = "disk1"
            size = 500
        }
      ]
      mem        = 8192
      cpu        = 3
    }
    "VM2" = {
      hostname = "VM2"
      ip_address = "10.1.122.101"
      datastore = "dstore-1"
      disks = [
        {
            label = "disk0"
            size = 60
        },
        {
            label = "disk1"
            size = 500
        }
      ]
      mem = 8192 
      cpu = 3
    }
    "VM3" = {
      hostname = "VM3"
      ip_address = "10.1.122.102"
      datastore = "dstore-1"
      disks = [
        {
            label = "disk0"
            size = 60
        },
        {
            label = "disk1"
            size = 500
        }
      ]
      mem = 8192 
      cpu = 3
    }
}
`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>I also created a terraform module that handles the rest of my VM configuration.
        This makes my terraform file nice and concise and easy to setup for my team members.
        Here's an example: 
      </p>

      <CodeBlock language='javascript' title='main.tf'>

 {`     terraform {
  required_providers {
    vsphere = {
      source  = "vmware/vsphere"
      version = "2.13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "vsphere" {
  # Configuration options
  user                 = var.vsphere_user
  password             = var.vsphere_password
  vsphere_server       = var.vsphere_server
  allow_unverified_ssl = true
  api_timeout          = 10
}

module "linux_vms" {
    source = "../../../modules/linux_VM"

    vm_folder = "Prod/Logging-Monitoring"
    resource_pool = "1 - High"
    network = "10.1.122.x"
    subnet = "23"
    gateway = "10.1.122.1"
    vm_configs = {
        "VM01" = {
          hostname   = "VM01"
          ip_address = "10.1.122.100"
          datastore = "Datastore-1"
          disks      = [
            {
                label = "disk0"
                size = 60
            },            
            { 
                label = "disk1"
                size = 50
            }
          ]
          mem        = 8192
          cpu        = 3
}
`} 
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Let's wrap it up</h2>
      <p>
        Once the VMs are provisioned I then follow up with ansible to finish up configuration.
        Unlike the configuration bash script I can run our ansible playbooks against all the 
        VMs that were just created at the same time. This saves a lot of time and it ensures
        that they are all configured the same way.
      </p>

      <p>
        One thing I've been meaning to look into and test out is triggering ansible playbooks
        via cloud-init. The way I understand it you would install ansible on the server via cloud-init 
        and then pull down your playbooks from a git repository and run them.
